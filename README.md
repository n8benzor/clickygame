## Game Functionality

Each logo is a clickable item on screen that once clicked will determine whether or not that logo has been clicked before. The more you click on new logo's that haven't been clicked, the higher your points will go. If you click all twelve logos successfully you will achieve a maximum high score of twelve and win the game. If you are unsuccessful then you lose.
